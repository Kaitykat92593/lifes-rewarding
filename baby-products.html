                    <p>
                        When you’re a mom you are always trying to find the best baby products. Things that make life
                        easier, things that occupy your kids, things that will keep them happy so you can take that
                        10-minute shower all to yourself, etc. With so many things on the market it can be so
                        overwhelming. You can look at all the baby sites and see all the reviews but what is really
                        going to work and be valuable to you is subjective to every family and parent. I remember when I
                        was pregnant with my first child and trying to research all of the things. I would spend hours
                        researching what was the best travel system, best swing, best crib, and the list could go on
                        forever. I also had to think about my budget because baby stuff can be so expensive. I was so
                        surprised that there were swings that could cost up to 500 dollars. There was no way I was
                        affording that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are cool niche products like a changing table that weighs your baby, swings that do a
                        different kinds of bounces and jumps, a bassinet that moves whenever your baby cried, but what I
                        found at least for me and my family was that I didn’t need to spend thousands and thousands and
                        that simple things like a regular bassinet that attached to my bed, a swing that just swung in
                        two directions, etc. were my favorite. So, for those mamas out there that don’t have millions to
                        spend on all the coolest gadgets I hope my list helps to narrow down what you might like and
                        hopefully you love these products as much as I do.

                        I love my Graco Modes Stroller and car seat combo. It has held up throughout all my kids and
                        I use my stroller for everything. They have updated it, but you can see the version I have if
                        you click the link above. This stroller is a modular stroller, and it was such a great price. I
                        love that the seat can recline and turn into a bassinet. I like that I can have baby facing me
                        or away. I like that the car seat can click right in. It has so much storage and cleans well.
                        This also has a 50-pound weight limit on the seat which is amazing. The car seat it came with is
                        light and easy to use. One thing to keep in mind is that this is only a single rider so if you
                        are going to have children close together you may want a single to double like the mockingbird
                        stroller. If I had to think of one negative this would be it but I knew that when I bought it
                        and I still love it.

                        If you jump on any mom forum and ask about diaper pails you will get a range of answers and
                        it won’t help you at all. This is so subjective to all families, but I have had that Ubbi diaper
                        pail for my first and still use it, so let me tell you all the reasons I love it. It holds the
                        smell in really well. I get to use my own trash bags and don’t need to spend a ton on specialty
                        trash bags, which is a major plus for me. For me personally it holds a weeks’ worth of diapers,
                        so I only have to take it out when the garbage is picked up. Now I do have a few cons, but the
                        pluses outweigh these for me so keep that in mind. When you open it, it does release a dirty
                        diaper odor, but it subsides quickly. It was fairly expensive at 75 dollars but now that I have
                        been able to use it for so long the price isn’t bad at all. All in all, I would buy it again and
                        it makes it, so I don’t have to walk down stairs to my garage every time I need to throw away a
                        diaper.

                        Burp clothes are so essential for me when having a baby. I used them for everything, spit up,
                        drool, etc. Now I did not purchase these but actually made a bunch for my first which we still
                        use for him and my second child. I will be making some more for this baby as well. They are
                        super simple to make but you can find these at any baby store as well.

                        We have a Graco swing which I absolutely love. My babies have loved it as well and it was the
                        only way I could get anything done with having two kids. It moves side to side or back and
                        forth, so it was really nice. The seat removes and turns into a bouncer which saves me space and
                        I didn’t have to purchase a whole separate item, which was a plus. The whole cover is removable
                        which makes it very easy to wash. It has held up for almost 6 years so I would definitely
                        recommend this swing to anyone.

                        With my first I just had a baby carrier and could not even use it well when he was a newborn
                        plus, he hated it. With my second I go the Solly baby wrap and I have loved that this so much I
                        got a second. I loved that I could have him close to me and that he was secure. He loved it as
                        well. It lasts forever. I mean if I really tried, I could totally still wrap my two-year-old in
                        it. For me I had no issues learning the technic, but this can be a challenge for some parents.
                        It can sometimes get a little warm, but the fabric is so thin, so you cool quickly as well. It
                        can be a bit expensive for a piece of fabric but was worth the money. I would recommend this to
                        all new parents. My son always fell asleep in this and was comfortable and I loved this.

                        up for storage when baby gets too big. I have been able to use it for quite a while with each of
                        my kids. They now have one that the mattress moves to the bottom, and I would recommend getting
                        that <a

                        Swaddle blankets are a must have for those first several months. They are so nice to have as
                        your kids get older as well to use as a thin blanket in the car. I used two different ones with
                        my second. I used the Aden and Anais muslin swaddles for each of my kids and love them. They
                        make a really nice thin blanket for the car, and we still use them. I like that they had tons of
                        patterns, so it fit the need for gender neutral but still being cute. They are soft and big, so
                        it makes it easy to wrap your baby up.

                        The second kind I used were sleeper ones. It would hold him in tighter than the other swaddles,
                        so I didn’t have to worry about it becoming loose. It also was cloth. This is not one I can use
                        as a blanket later, so it is only for sleep, but I loved them. They grew with my son, and I
                        would totally recommend getting some that are just for sleep like <a

                        For me because I was breastfeeding a nursing pillow was a must. I liked the much thicker ones as

                        which I love the options. It helps to hold the baby up and give you at least one free arm. There
                        are so many out there, so you just need to find the one that works for you, but I found this one

                        If you plan to breastfeed a good breast pump is a necessity, at least it was for me. For my
                        first I used the <a

                            Pump in Style</a> and I really liked it, no complaints. It emptied the milk
                        really well and it was a great size for travel. For my second I used the Spectra S2, and I love
                        that pump. Comparing the two I would say to get the Spectra I found it worked really well, was
                        quiet and had more modes to get the milk to express. It was awesome. The S2 is one that you need
                        to plug in so I would recommend upgrading to the S1 if you don't want to be constantly tethered
                        to the wall. In both of these cases my insurance covered them so I would speak with insurance
                        first before going out and buying them. I would also recommend a

                            breast pump</a> as well. It is a manual pump, but it helped me so much this first few months
                        while my supply was leveling out. It can be attached to the opposite breast while breast feeding

                        trips to help with engorgement and there are also ways that it can be useful to clear clogged
                        ducts.

                        ointment until you and baby are more settled into a routine. I would recommend asking your

                        and liked it, but it wasn’t cutting it the second time for me. A good bag for
                        your
                        pump and supplies was a lifesaver for me as well. Storage bags for your pumped milk. I like the

                        This one is subjective to each family as well, but I hated filling up my big bathtub when we
                        would only probably use half of that. For me a baby tub was a must. I have the skip hop whale
                        tub and have used it for both of my kids. I love that I can put baby in it, and it has a sling.
                        It was so nice to not have to worry about filling a big tub of water and only getting the water
                        we needed. It also allowed me to be able to have them in a good position for washing. I could
                        use it on the counter if I wanted and it was super easy to empty. We have also used this to give
                        my kids milk baths and loved the ability to keep them more contained for a while. It also hangs
                        to store so it was never in my way when I didn’t need it.
